# Bishop-PRML-Book-Resources
Bishop PRML is considered THE book for people starting out in ML/DL and for those interested in a Mathematical Dive. For an average student like me I have always found it difficult to stick to the book and crack the book. I am in the journey of understanding this book well and wanted to document resources I used to understand this book, so this might serve as a reference for others and save time.
